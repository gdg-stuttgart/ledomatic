## Hardware

### arduino 

arduino is great way to prototype simple devices. It has following advantages:

  * open harware and open source software
  * the heart is atmega chip from Atmel
  * expandable with shields
  * great community (lots of samples, great forums, very good homepage)
  * amazing how easy&quick is to get to blink a led for the first time 

### Seagate dockstar

Seagate dockstar ist network area storage (NAS), disk storage running and accesible on the LAN. 
Running modern ARM CPU from Marwell on 1.2GHz with 1Gbit Ethernet interface able to runs proper linux 
distribution. The hardware is very similar to sheevaplug, but much cheaper. In th esummer 2010 you can buy it
fro 20€. Even now, after seagate stoped a production of the device, you can get it for 50€. It is just 
"no brainer" for the money for hacking.

The leds are connected to digital outputs on the arduino, so to control an intesity of LED and fro mixing of
color we are using pulse wide modulation. Arduino makes it by hardware. we need just to used some transistros to 
switch 12V and drive enought current for the leds stripe (you need to switch 36W on the 5 meter of the stripe).
